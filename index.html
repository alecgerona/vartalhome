                    We tame technology to make it deliver what you want, when you want, and how you want. We achieve that not by being specialised in any particular discipline, but to commit to delivering quality solutions; regardless of what we need to do behind the scenes to make that happen for you. Put simply, we strive to have the skills to get the job done, and our problems don't become your problem.

                        <p>Without Vartaltech the Twenteen site would not be what it is today. Vartaltech organised everything from the dedicated web server set up to the customised Magento eCommerce application and other software to the ongoing maintenance. As well, Vartaltech has written custom software that allows our applications to talk to each other, saving us countless hours of work. Because of how Vartaltech has set up our site, we are now able to host other eCommerce stores as well as our own, which gives us an extra income source we didn't expect to have.
